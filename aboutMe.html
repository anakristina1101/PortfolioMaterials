          Hi I'm Ana, and I am a Chicago native but I have always had a love of
          'Small Town America' even though I am technically a city girl. I lived
          in Culver, IN while attending boarding school in high school, and
          Culver is as Small Town America as America can get. I am married to my
          high school sweetheart, like a smalltown girl would be, typical right!
          We have 3 amazing children, Logan who is 5, Zayn who is 3, and Autumn
          Rose who is 8 months.
        </p>

        I work at a tech company that allows small buisnesses to do email
        marketing. I'm on the Account Management team, but most of my friends
        are on the Engineering team. They have convinced me their team is "where
        its at" so I have decided to become a Software engineer as well. I love
        that Engineering will give me the opportunity for a career and skills
        that I can take to nearly every industry
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not at work or in class with you fine folks. I love to be with
        my family as well as go out with my girl friends. I love traveling as
        well. My most recent trip was with my immediate and extended family to
        Puerto Rico for a week in June. We stayed a Mega Manison Air BNB like we
        were celebrities. It was amazing!
      </p>

      <p>
        I look forward to learning more in this class, more time with family and
        friends, and planning the next big extended family getaway.
